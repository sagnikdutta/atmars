# Introduction #

<p><b>MyEclipse</b> is a commercially available Java EE and Ajax IDE created and maintained by the company Genuitec, a founding member of the Eclipse Foundation.</p>


# Details #

  * <p>MyEclipse is built upon the Eclipse platform,<a href='1.md'>1</a> and integrates both proprietary and open source solutions<a href='2.md'>2</a> into the development environment.</p>
  * <p>MyEclipse has two primary versions (apart from the "Blue Edition<a href='3.md'>3</a> and "MyEclipse Spring Edition<a href='4.md'>4</a> referred to below): a professional and a standard edition.<a href='5.md'>5</a> The standard edition adds database tools, a visual web designer, persistence tools, Spring tools, Struts and JSF tooling, and a number of other features to the basic Eclipse Java Developer profile. It competes with the Web Tools Project, which is a part of Eclipse itself, but MyEclipse is a separate project entirely and offers a different feature set.</p>
  * <p>MyEclipse has also been made available via Pulse (ALM),<a href='6.md'>6</a> a provisioning tool that maintains Eclipse software profiles, including those that use MyEclipse. Additionally, MyEclipse is offering a customized version for IBM products, "MyEclipse Blue Edition",<a href='7.md'>7</a> that adds specific support for Rational Software and WebSphere development. Currently, MyEclipse Blue Edition is available for Windows and Linux, though Mac is unsupported.</p>
